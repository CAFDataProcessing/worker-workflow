* [SCMOD-10362](https://portal.digitalsafe.net/browse/SCMOD-10362): Migrate from Nashorn to Graal.JS  
The Nashorn engine (scheduled for removal in [JEP372](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/372)) has been deprecated and will 
be replaced with the GraalVM JavaScript engine. This necessitated a number of changes to the workflow control script 
that are incompatible with workers built on a worker-document framework version older than 4.5.0.
