* [SCMOD-10362](https://portal.digitalsafe.net/browse/SCMOD-10362): Migrate from Nashorn to Graal.JS  
The Nashorn engine (scheduled for removal in [JEP372](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/372)) has been replaced
with the GraalVM JavaScript engine. This change necessitated a number of changes to the workflow control script that 
are incompatible with worker built on a worker-document framework version older than 5.0.0.
